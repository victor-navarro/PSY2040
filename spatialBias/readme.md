## Read me por favor

If you are here, you have chosen to get involved in programming your experiment.
During this semester, I will program the experiments in **Octave**, using **Psychtoolbox** extensions.

If you use Windows, here is what you need to get started:

1. Install [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/#install)
2. Install the MSVC binary of [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download/). Remember, the MSVC binary! not the MinGW binary.
3. Install [Psychtoolbox](http://psychtoolbox.org/download.html). My recommendation is to download the zip file, extract the Psychtoolbox folder anywhere you want, and from Octave, cd into the folder, and run SetupPsychtoolbox.m
4. Download the files in this repository and extract them wherever you want. Then, from Octave, cd into the folder and run any of the scripts. Alternatively, open the file in Octave, and press the button that's a cog with a play button.

If you use MAC or Linux, the installation of Octave should be straightforward. The installation of Psychtoolbox should not require GStreamer, so skip step 2 of the previous tutorial.

If you do not have much experience programming, or are not familiar with Octave or Psychtoolbox, you can find tutorials [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHGqwF2s-tM) and [here](http://peterscarfe.com/ptbtutorials.html).
Most of the basic MATLAB tutorials also apply to Octave, so you can consult those, too.
